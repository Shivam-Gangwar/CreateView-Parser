# CreateView-Parser
This project aims to build a Parser that can parse SQL CREATE VIEW statements using lex and yacc . Syntax of SQL Create View statement and the grammar which we are  using are given.  Some assumptions have been made by us which are given further to  give a clearer view of the query which is passed to the parser.
